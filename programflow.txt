### 🧠 **Understanding What's Happening in Simple Language**

You're using **Git** to manage your **code** and using **DVC (Data Version Control)** to manage your **data files** (like CSVs) more efficiently, especially when they are large and change over time. Git isn’t good for tracking big files (like datasets), so we let DVC handle them.

Let’s walk through what each step is doing:

---

#### 🔧 **STEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATION**

1. **Create a Git repo and clone it**
   - You're starting a new Git project and downloading it to your local machine.

2. **Create a Python file and save a CSV file using it**
   - Write `mycode.py` that creates a `data` folder and saves a `.csv` file in it.

3. **Add-commit-push to Git**
   - You save your code and the `data` folder in Git (even though we'll soon move the data out of Git).

4. **Initialize DVC**
   - You run `dvc init`, which sets up DVC in your project (adds `.dvc`, `.dvcignore` files).

5. **Create a folder named `S3`**
   - You make a folder (we'll simulate an S3 bucket here).

6. **Connect DVC to remote storage**
   - You tell DVC, “this S3 folder is where I want to store data.” The `-d` means "set this as default."

7. **Try adding `data/` to DVC**
   - DVC sees that Git is already tracking `data/`, so it tells you to remove it from Git's tracking.

8. **Actually remove `data/` from Git and let DVC track it**
   - You run the suggested `git rm -r --cached data/` and commit the change.
   - Now when you run `dvc add data/`, it creates `data.dvc`, a small file that tells DVC how to manage the `data/` folder.

9. **DVC and Git push**
   - `dvc commit`: Prepares the data version.
   - `dvc push`: Uploads the actual data to the S3 remote.
   - `git add-commit-push`: Save this version of code + `.dvc` file to Git. Now everything is synced and versioned!

10. **Change the data**
   - Update `mycode.py` to append a row to your CSV file.
   - Run `dvc status` to see if data has changed.

11. **Commit new data version**
   - Run `dvc commit` to tell DVC, “Hey, data changed.”
   - Then `dvc push` to send it to remote storage.

12. **Git save**
   - Use `git add-commit-push` again to save this as a new version of your code+data reference.

13. **Check status**
   - Ensure both Git and DVC are up-to-date.

14. **Repeat for v3**
   - Keep making changes to your data and repeat steps 10–12 to version it as V3.

### ✅ **SEQUENTIAL STEPS (Simplified and Clean)**

#### 🧱 SETUP & INITIAL VERSION (V1)
1. Create Git repo and clone it.
2. Create `mycode.py` that saves a CSV to a `data/` folder.
3. `git add .` → `git commit -m "Initial commit"` → `git push`
4. `pip install dvc` (if not already installed)
5. `dvc init`
6. `mkdir S3`
7. `dvc remote add -d myremote S3`
8. `dvc add data/`  
   - If prompted:  
     - `git rm -r --cached data/`  
     - `git commit -m "Stop tracking data with Git"`
9. `dvc add data/` (again, to create `data.dvc`)
10. `git add .gitignore data.dvc` → `git commit -m "Track data with DVC"` → `git push`
11. `dvc commit` → `dvc push`
12. `git add .` → `git commit -m "V1 of data"` → `git push`

---

#### 🔁 VERSION 2 (V2)
13. Modify `mycode.py` to append new row to the CSV
14. `dvc status` (to check for changes)
15. `dvc commit` → `dvc push`
16. `git add .` → `git commit -m "V2 of data"` → `git push`

---

#### 🔁 VERSION 3 (V3)
17. Again modify `mycode.py` to append another row
18. `dvc status`
19. `dvc commit` → `dvc push`
20. `git add .` → `git commit -m "V3 of data"` → `git push`
